        | Although MUGH started life as DNUG (.NET Users Group), we felt that various
        | Microsoft technologies function so well in concert with each other and our
        | earlier name did restrict our scope to just one of them. Today we have special
        | groups branched into various fields under MUGH, namely DNUG (a dot net user group),
        | IT Pro (a user group for it community), SQLCon (India's first SQL community),
        | a studentâ€™s group and supports various other user groups from different regions.

        | MUGH is operated by a core group that consists of Microsoft MVPs and Community Stars.
        | Microsoft often helps us in conducting our activities that include user group meetings,
        | developer conferences, annual events.
